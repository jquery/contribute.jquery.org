	"title": "jQuery Foundation Copyright Assignment Agreement"
}</script>

For good and valuable consideration, receipt of which I acknowledge, I hereby
transfer to jQuery Foundation, Inc. (the "Foundation") my entire right, title,
and interest (including all rights under copyright) in my changes and enhancements
to any code or other work contributed by me to the open source project commonly
known as the jQuery Project or any other project managed by the Foundation.
These changes and enhancements are herein called the "Work." The work hereby
assigned shall also include any future revisions of these changes and enhancements
hereafter made by me.

For the purposes of this Assignment, a work "based on the Work" means any work
that in whole or in part incorporates or is derived from all or part of the Work.

The Foundation agrees to grant me non-exclusive rights to use the Work (i.e., my
changes and enhancements, not the program which I enhanced) as I see fit and the
Foundation's rights shall otherwise remain unchanged.

The Foundation promises that all distribution of the Work, or of any work "based
on the Work", that takes place under the control of the Foundation or its agents
or assignees, shall be on terms that explicitly and perpetually permit anyone
possessing a copy of the work to which the terms apply, and possessing accurate
notice of these terms, to redistribute copies of such work to anyone on the same
terms. These terms shall not restrict which members of the public copies may be
distributed to. These terms shall not require a member of the public to pay any
royalty to the Foundation or to anyone else for any permitted use of the work
they apply to, or to communicate with the Foundation or its agents in any way
either when redistribution is performed or on any other occasion.

The Foundation promises that all distribution of the Work, or of any work "based
on the Work," offered to the public by the Foundation or its assignees shall be
offered in the form of machine-readable source code, in addition to any other
forms of the Foundation's choosing. However, the Foundation is free to choose at
its convenience the media of distribution for machine-readable source code.

I hereby agree that if I have or acquire hereafter any patent or interface
copyright or other intellectual property interest dominating the program enhanced
by the Work (or use of that program), such dominating interest will not be used
to undermine the effect of this assignment, i.e., the Foundation and the general
public will be licensed to use, in that program and its derivative works, without
royalty or limitation, the subject matter of the dominating interest. This license
provision will be binding on my heirs, assignees, or other successors to the
dominating interest, as well as on me.

I hereby represent and warrant that I am the sole copyright holder for the Work
and that I have the right and power to enter into this contract. I hereby
indemnify and hold harmless the Foundation, its officers, employees, and agents
against any and all claims, actions or damages (including attorney's reasonable
fees) asserted by or paid to any party on account of a breach or alleged breach
of the foregoing warranty. I make no other express or implied warranty (including
without limitation, in this disclaimer of warranty, any warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE).

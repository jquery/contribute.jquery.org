}</script>

Contributing to the jQuery project, and to any
[FOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software) project for
that matter, can be a rewarding experience both in terms of the way you can
help yourself and projects you are working on, as well as the countless number
of others you may help with your contribution. Taking that first step though,
can be intimidating. From learning new technologies, to interacting with people
you have never met, to putting yourself and your code out for the world to see,
there are many factors that may act as barriers to entry. Hopefully, this
document will give you that push you need to get past those reservations and
get involved.

## Dive In

Often, folks have an idea of what they want to contribute to an open source
project before they even think about how they would do it. But even if you have
no idea what you want to contribute, there is probably some way that you can
make your mark.

The obvious way is to contribute to the code base. Perhaps you have been fixing
bugs in a particular piece of software that you use in your projects. Maybe you
have created a new addition to a library that you think will be helpful to
others as part of the larger project. These and many other types of everyday
tasks that programmers do are perfect examples of ways to give back to the open
source community.

But you don't necessarily have to write code to contribute. Projects are almost
always looking for help with creating or updating documentation and the web
sites and other items that accompany them. If someone doesn't know why a
project exists or how to use it, what reason would they have to give it a try?
Telling someone in an effective way what a project is for and how to use it is
just as important as providing the code for them to use. And it doesn't end
there. From helping to maintain infrastructure to event planning, projects need
help in many areas beyond the code.

## Join the Conversation

So now you know what you want to contribute but you're not sure where to start.
Most projects provide a number of ways for you to discuss features, express
concerns or just chat about the project with other people just like you.

### Reporting and Fixing Bugs

At least you think you found a bug. The best thing to do is to first try to
narrow that issue down to as minimal of a test case as you can to make sure
it's an issue with the project. You wouldn't want someone to tell you that you
did something wrong if they didn't have proof that it's your fault, right? Once
you know it's the project's issue, make sure they don't already know about it by
checking their system for bug tracking. There may already be a discussion in
progress that you can contribute to or at least follow for a resolution. If the
project doesn't know about this bug, then it's time to tell them about it.
Projects usually have a preferred method for reporting bugs so try to follow
that method and let them know about it. And better yet, provide the fix too!

### Contributing Something New

So you have added a feature to a library or you have created something new
based on someone else's work or maybe you just have some bit of code that you
use all the time in your projects and now you want to give that to the
community and let them enjoy the same benefits you have. Great! This is how
open source projects begin, grow, thrive and reach new users.

If you've created something new, put it out there! Shout it from the mountain
tops and get people to use and contribute to it. If you're wanting to
contribute something to an existing project though, let's slow it down a bit.
There are a few questions you might need to ask yourself, or the maintainer(s)
of the project may ask you.

**How does this change help others?** Most likely the answer to this question
is the same way the change helped you. Keep in mind though that not everyone is
in the same situation as you and if your solution is too specific to your needs
it may not be seen as something beneficial to everyone else.

**Why would the project maintain this code for you?** Let's face it, any
addition to a library is more work for the people maintaining that project. So
what benefit does the project get from your contribution? It could be more
users or the opportunity to catch up to a competing project or the ability to
fill a gap in the project's functionality. Whatever the reason, it should be a
compelling one to convince the project team that they should take that code off
of your hands and merge it with theirs.

And what if the project decides not to include your contribution? That's ok!
You can still use it yourself. You can still, within guidelines of any license
that may be in place, distribute it yourself. There are ways to contribute to a
project and its community without actually having your bits merged.

### Being a Good Citizen

Open source projects are small communities of like-minded individuals coming
together over a common interest or skill set. As with any community, there are
appropriate ways to conduct yourself when interacting with other members of
that group. Treating others with respect is not just courteous, but it helps
encourage new people that may have important contributions to feel comfortable
enough to put themselves out there and take that first step toward getting
involved.

Whether you're answering questions in a forum, chatting with someone at a
conference or commenting on a section of someone's code, keep in mind that your
words and your actions have real consequences. Treat others how you would like
to be treated and keep in mind that we were all beginners at some point. When
you encounter a community member that doesn't follow or understand the
[mores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mores), just remember that someone once
helped you and pass on the kindness.

## (Being Willing To) Add to Your Toolbelt

A major factor that often keeps developers from contributing to open source
projects is a lack of comfort with the tools and workflows that are typically
employed. The most common stumbling blocks for newcomers tend to be

* the command line
* version control
* local development

Depending on your background, these may be normal parts of your
everyday workflow, or they may be intimidating obstacles that send you running
in the opposite direction every time you scan a README. Before delving into a bit
more detail about each of these and why it's important, here are some important things 
to keep in mind.

* **It's OK to not already know.** Not be able to use the same tools you know your peers are already adept with can feel embarrassing, as can having to say "I don't know." No one springs forth from the womb with a magical ability to collaborate on distributed software projects, and at some point everyone had to invest the time to learn the tools. 
* **You don't have to know *everything* to do *anything.* ** Learning these tools is a process, and you don't have to be a master of any of them to contribute effectively. You just have to be willing to try.
* **This will make you a better developer.** If you aren't using any of these, they can be a major boon to your productivity and introduce you techniques that can apply in other facets of your career
* **You're part of a community now.**  There are other people out there that have had the same problems, and are ready, willing and able to share with you how they
overcame their issues and how you can too.
* **You can do it!** There are literally *millions* of software developers in the world who use these tools each day. If you're already writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we have faith you can join them!

### The Command Line

If you aren't used to the command line (or shell, or terminal, or "scary black
box", etc), then you've probably had the frustrating experience of coming
across a project where the documentation states that "getting started with *X*
is simple" and then proceeds to list a series of commands that you find
confusing and anything but simple. You probably looked for a GUI way to
complete the task, or just gave up entirely. While there are many fine GUI
applications out there for all sorts of software development tasks, over time
you'll find the need to become comfortable with the command line grows.

Whether you're managing your files, editing their contents or
interacting with code repositories, at some point the more granular control and
efficient interface of the command line can become a warm blanket you wrap
yourself in when you sit down to work. Once you're ready to take the leap, here are a 
few resources you may find beneficial.

### Local Development

Many open source projects use [git](http://git-scm.com/) for managing their
source code. Working locally on that code, instead of on the actual "origin"
source files may take some getting used to but is not a major hurdle to leap
over. When submitting changes to the originating repository, a developer does
what is called a Pull Request which, as the name describes, asks the owners of
the repo to "pull" the changes from your copy of the files into theirs.

Within git, one of your best friends will be the branch. A branch is a sort of
snapshot in time of the code you are working on. The main branch is called the
master branch and you can create any number of addition branches. When
preparing to make changes for a pull request it is highly recommended to make
those changes in a branch other than master. That way, your master branch isn't
stuck with your changes awaiting approval. This can lead to all kinds of messes
like not being able to work on other items or creating branches off of the
modified master branch and thus including possibly unapproved changes in later
pull requests. Git is a powerful tool and we could write an entire article on
it ... oh wait, [we did](../commits-and-pull-requests/).

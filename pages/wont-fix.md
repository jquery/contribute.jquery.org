title: Won't Fix

## Object.prototype Issues

Modifying the Object.prototype is a bad idea - it'll break a lot of code, and
not just in jQuery. While the fix inside jQuery would be relatively simple
(using hasOwnProperty in a number of loops) the performance overhead would be
considerable, thus we're not inclined to fix issues related to this.

## SVG/VML/Namespaced Elements Bugs

jQuery is primarily a library for the HTML DOM, so most problems related to SVG/XML/VML 
documents or namespaced elements are out of scope. We do try to address problems
that "bleed through" to HTML documents, such as events that bubble out of SVG.

## Warnings in Console

There are some limited cases where an unavoidable warning (not an error) is
produced in the Firefox console. This has been resolved in later versions of
Firefox - and fixing it in jQuery itself would result in a compromised
experience for users. A similar problem exists in some versions of Chrome,
which generate console warnings.

## CSS Transition/Animation/Transforms

While some browsers do provide native means of doing CSS animations, most of
that has been encapsulated into plugins. We will continue to recommend that
users use those plugins for that particular functionality.

Plugins available:

* [jQuery Animate Enhanced](https://github.com/benbarnett/jQuery-Animate-Enhanced/)
* [jquery.transform.js](https://github.com/louisremi/jquery.transform.js)
* [jQuery++ Animate](http://jquerypp.com/#animate)

## Native Selector Bugs

Frequently browsers have regressions with their implementations of
`querySelectorAll`, which causes problems with jQuery's selectors. Thankfully
these issues are usually fixed quickly. If they aren't that severe then we
just bump them back to the browser vendor and let them handle it.
If it's seriously detrimental, then we'll try our best to fix it on our end.

## Inline Event Handlers

In general, inline event handlers are incredibly hard to work with and should
not be used. In nearly all cases, issues involving inline event handlers are
out of scope.

## Quirks Mode

Some browsers provide a "Quirks Mode" that does not conform to the standard W3C
CSS box model; jQuery does not support this mode due to the differences it
introduces in measuring element dimensions and positions. To ensure that an
HTML document does not render in Quirks Mode, always use a doctype at the top
of the document.

## jQuery UI

### change Event

Widgets that enhance form elements manipulate their element's `value` programmatically, 
therefore we cannot guarantee that a native `change` event will fire when the element's 
`value` changes.

These widgets do all provide a custom `change` event.  For example, the autocomplete 
widget fires an [autocompletechange](http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-change) event.

### Cloning

Cloning widgets is not supported by jQuery UI.  It is simply too much effort specific 
to each widget to handle for an uncommon use case.  If you are interested in adding
this functionality feel free to contact the jQuery UI team.
